    "# Investigate the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the cumulative project on clustering algorithms! In this project, we will be investigating the way people think about masculinity by applying the KMeans algorithm to data from  <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/\" target = \"_blank\">FiveThirtyEight</a>. FiveThirtyEight is a popular website known for their use of statistical analysis in many of their stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, take a look at `masculinity-survey.pdf`. FiveThirtyEight and WNYC studios used this survey to get their male readers' thoughts on masculinity. After looking through some of the questions asked, take a look at FiveThirtyEight's article <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/\" target = \"_blank\">What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?</a> to see their major takeaways. We're going to try to find more insights using machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, we've loaded `masculinity.csv` into a DataFrame named `survey`. This file contains the raw responses to the masculinity survey. Let's start getting a sense of how this data is structured. Try to answer these questions using your Pandas knowledge:\n",
    "* What are the names of the columns? How do those columns relate to the questions in the PDF?\n",
    "* How many rows are there?\n",
    "* How is a question with multiple parts, like question 7, represented in the DataFrame?\n",
    "* How many people said they often ask a friend for professional advice? This is the first sub-question in question 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that last question, use the `value_counts()` function. For example, `df[\"col_a\"].value_counts()` gives you a nice summary of the values found in `\"col_a\"` of the DataFrame `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to print `survey.head()` to get a sense of all of the columns.\n"

    "# Mapping the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for us to start thinking about using the KMeans algorithm with this data, we need to first figure out how to turn these responses into numerical data. Let's once again consider question 7. We can't cluster the data using the phrases `\"Often\"` or `\"Rarely\"`, but we can turn those phrases into numbers. For example, we could map the data in the following way: \n",
    "* `\"Often\"` -> `4`\n",
    "* `\"Sometimes\"` ->  `3`\n",
    "* `\"Rarely\"` -> `2` \n",
    "* `\"Never, but open to it\"` -> `1`\n",
    "* `\"Never, and not open to it\"` -> `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it's important that these responses are somewhat linear. `\"Often\"` is at one end of the spectrum with `\"Never, and not open to it\"` at the other. The other values fall in sequence between the two. You could perform a similar mapping for the `\"educ4\"` responses (question 29), but there isn't an obvious linear progression in the `\"racethn4\"` responses (question 28).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this transformation, use the `map()` function. `map()` takes a dictionary as a parameter. For example, the following line of code would turn all the `\"A\"`s into `1`s and all the `\"B\"`s into `2`s in the column `\"col_one\"`.\n",
