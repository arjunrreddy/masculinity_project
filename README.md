# masculinity_project

In this project, I will be investigating the way people think about masculinity by applying the KMeans algorithm to data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/).

I was reading through an article on FiveThirtyEight titled [What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/) and I figured I might be able to use the data from the survey to get male readers' thoughts on masculinity.
