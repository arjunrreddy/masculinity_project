# masculinity_project

In this project, I will be investigating the way people think about masculinity by applying the KMeans algorithm to data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)

FiveThirtyEight and WNYC studios used this survey to get their male readers' thoughts on masculinity. I came across this idea by reading FiveThirtyEight's article What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?.
